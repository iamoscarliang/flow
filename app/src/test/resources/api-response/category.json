        "title": "F1 driver market 'going to erupt very soon' with established drivers to be axed",
        "body": "Sky Sports pundit Anthony Davidson has forecasted a seismic shift in the F1 driver market, predicting an imminent 'eruption' that could see top drivers ousted. Davidson confessed he senses the \"driver market is about to erupt\" and anticipates significant changes following Lewis Hamilton's bombshell move to Ferrari.\n\nIn a stunning turn of events, 39-year-old Hamilton confirmed his departure from Mercedes in February, setting his sights on a new chapter with Ferrari for the 2025 season. This leaves Mercedes' team principal Toto Wolff with the daunting task of finding a worthy successor to pair with George Russell, as speculation swirls around who will fill the coveted seat.\n\nCarlos Sainz finds himself in limbo after being replaced at Ferrari, who opted to retain Charles Leclerc alongside their new star Hamilton. The upheaval doesn't stop there; nearly half the F1 grid, including big names like Sergio Perez and Fernando Alonso, are approaching the end of their contracts, leaving them in the free-agent pool.\n\nWith contracts expiring for both drivers at teams such as Haas, Aston Martin, Alpine, Sauber and Visa Cash App RB, Davidson is bracing for a flurry of activity in the driver market. Speaking to Sky Sports, Davidson said: \"I really get the feeling that the driver market is about to erupt. I don't know if it will happen this weekend, or other weekends coming, but it's going to happen soon.\n\n\"And when it does I've just got a feeling that we're going to have new drivers coming in, drivers that are established here may be leaving. I feel like it's going to be quite a big turnaround.\"",

        "title": "'I showed myself that I could do that': Brayden Nichols' triumphant return to Hallsville baseball",
        "body": "It's March 21, and Hallsville senior pitcher Brayden Nichols is making his first start of the 2024 season.\n\nAlmost immediately, Nichols' ability is tested.\n\nWith a man on first base, a North Callaway player smashed a line drive right back at Nichols. Quickly, he reacted just in time to catch the ball before throwing to first for a double play.\n\n\"He was fired up,\" Hallsville head coach Jordan Carmack said. \"You could really see the adrenaline and everything.\"\n\n\"It was a screamer right back (at me),\" Nichols said. \"It definitely loosened the nerves a little bit.\"\n\nMore: Battle, Hickman and Rock Bridge to add boys volleyball and girls STUNT\n\nMore: Why Hickman's victory over Jefferson City could serve as a turning point this season\n\nIn the bigger picture, it was a victorious moment for Nichols.\n\nJust weeks before, he didn't know if he didn't know if he would be able to participate in his senior year of high school baseball. Before that, a near-death accident left him unsure if he was even going to be active for the rest of his life.\n\nSports have been Nichols' life. He's participated in basketball and football, but baseball is the sport he wanted to play in college.\n\nIn the winter of 2023, those plans changed.\n\nDriving at approximately 60 mph, Nichols was in a significant car accident, hitting a stop-light pole. Had emergency personnel gotten him to the hospital two minutes later than they did, medical professionals likely would have pronounced him dead on arrival.\n\nNichols fractured his femur, and a shattered ball in his hip required partial replacement surgery. He fractured his pelvis while also having his spleen removed.\n\nMiraculously, Nichols survived. Due to the severity of his injuries, however, it should have meant the end of sports. Even baseball.\n\n\"The doctors actually told me that I would never be able to play again,\" Nichols said. \"They said that, depending on what type of surgery ... I probably wouldn't be able to do any sort of active lifestyle ever again.\"\n\nNichols credited his father, Adam Nichols, his mother, Beth Wright, his girlfriend, Sophie, and current Hickman head coach Justin Conyers for support and words of encouragement in the hospital.\n\nThey, as well as friends and teammates that he grew up with, visited him in the hospital. He remained involved with activities as much as he could within the Hallsville community, which helped ease the mental process.\n\n\"We would try to make him laugh,\" senior Colton Nichols said. \"Make him feel like he was not even missing, really just tried our best to make him feel like he was still out there.\"\n\nWhile he appreciated the moral support, that only went so far. Something was still missing.\n\n\"It just sucked seeing everybody else, seeing all my friends being able to play,\" Nichols said. \"Obviously, I love being there for them but not being able to actually be on the field and compete ... to not have that competitive edge anymore, it really took a lot out of me.\"\n\n\"Devastation\" is the word that Wright used.\n\n\"We just kept telling him, and you can only tell them so much, hey, at least you're alive. A kid can only hear that so much. People are like, 'Yeah, I'm alive but I can't do anything,'\" Wright said. \"We just kept encouraging him to keep pushing and trying to find someone else that he could wrap his mind around doing. But that's hard.\"\n\nThis wasn't the first time Nichols had physical setbacks. And his return to the field in 2024 wasn't the first time he'd defied a timetable to return, either.\n\nAccording to his father, Nichols tore his labrum the year before his wreck. The doctors told him that he would be out a whole calendar year, but was back in five months. Prior to that, a knee injury left doctors thinking he'd be out for 10 months. He returned in less than six.\n\nConyers has known Brayden Nichols since he was little; he and Adam have been longtime friends. Carmack met Nichols when he was in the third grade. Each describes him having great tenacity.\n\n\"Anything he's been doing athletic-wise, it just seems like the ball just never seems to bounce the right way for this young man but he's been resilient throughout the whole deal,\" Conyers said.\n\nWhile the odds were not in his favor, Nichols was determined.\n\n\"You can ask anybody, man, the day that he had surgery, he woke up and the first thing he was thinking about is when can I get up and when can I start walking,\" Adam Nichols said.\n\nHis body once again began healing quicker than expected. The doctors, though, still told him there was no shot that he was going to be able to do anything active.\n\nGradually, however, a window opened for Nichols to do what was thought impossible: Compete in his senior baseball season.\n\n\"I went in for a followup appointment about a week or two before the season and they actually told me I have to have another surgery because I have bone spurs,\" Nichols said. \"And that's actually when they told me that they cleared me to pitch so kind of it was good and bad.\"\n\nHe thought the news would surprise a lot of people, but it was the exact opposite.\n\n\"As crazy as it sounds, man, I wasn't shocked at all,\" Adam Nichols said. \"Even though he gets hurt a lot, he's always healed pretty quickly. So even though it was a surprise, it really wasn't a surprise to me. He told me all along that he was going to be back, and I believed that.\"\n\nPhysically, Nichols still isn't 100%. He's still doing physical therapy, and his body still aches and hurts when he wakes up. On the mound, Nichols can't throw nearly as hard as he used to due to his cadaver hip causing limited drive in his leg.\n\n\"I just had to change the whole approach, the whole mindset of how much I'm trying to throw myself...It's something that your mind and your body kind of work together when you're out there, and it just flows,\" Nichols said.\n\nNevertheless, he and his family haven't had more fun playing baseball.\n\n\"It's beautiful. We spent his entire life from the age of five up until the accident playing sports and competing, and that's what he always loved to do,\" Adam Nichols said. \"Now he's getting to do it again, it's a little different, it looks different than it used to, but man, it's everything to me to see him to get to compete again.\"\n\nIn that first game vs. North Callaway, he pitched almost three full innings before being pulled as his body was still adjusting to the workload. It was emotional to those who believed deep down there was a chance that he would be back.\n\n\"I won't lie, his first pitch that he threw this year, I cried,\" Wright said. \"I can't even really put into words what it was to see him back out there and the pure joy and a smile on his face, to know that he did it, that he was able to do it.\"\n\nThe screamer right back at him in the first inning against North Callaway proved that his body could react to anything.\n\n\"I showed myself that I could do that, that was probably the thing that I was most scared about was screaming right back at me and not being able to react fast enough but being able to react showed me that I could be out there and I could still do it,\" Nichols said.\n\nWhen Nichols made another appearance and didn't give any runs, he made another decision.\n\n\"He got off the field and said, 'Dad, maybe we should talk to the doctor about pushing (the second surgery) back because I feel pretty good and I'd like to finish the season,\" Adam Nichols said.\n\nWhile Nichols had to adjust his game, he also successfully adjusted off the field as the accident changed his entire outlook on life.\n\n\"I mean you just appreciate everything, just the little stuff, being able to just get up in the morning and just walk around being able to be out there and practice,\" Nichols said. \"Every athlete had days where they were like, I don't want to go to practice, I don't want to go to the game. I don't want to do all that. Just being able to be out there changed the whole outlook of everything.\"\n\nAfter graduation, Nichols plans to attend State Tech, where he wants to pursue energy management.\n\nWhile he won't be able to play collegiately, he might have a future in coaching. His 14-year-old brother looks up to him, according to Wright, and he is always mentoring and coaching up the younger players on an inexperienced Hallsville team.\n\n\"Every time something happens that I feel like could be a good teaching moment I look at that and I ask them what they could have done better,\" Nichols said. \"I'm really just trying to get them engaged in the game.\"\n\nThere's still a lot of baseball to be played. Hallsville has four regular season games and the Southern Boone Classic before beginning district play. Nichols for now is cherishing the time in the Hallsville community that he's grown up in.\n\n\"Everybody knows each other, all the boys. So excited to be back out there whenever I'm pitching out there, just the words of encouragement from everybody else, it just makes me feel real good,\" Nichols said.",

        "body": "A long season of preparing, practicing and perfecting paid off. The Narragansett Regional cheer team returned from Hershey, Penn. with its new title of National Champion.\n\nLast week, the Warriors cheer squad traveled to Hershey for the Eastern National High School Cheerleading Championships. After a successful winter competition season, earning first at the league championship and fourth at the regional championship, the team was set for their final endeavor of the year - Nationals.\n\nThe hard work and determination was evident by the way the team performed at Nationals, hitting its jumps and stunts and staying in sync for the choreography. The team and coaches agreed they thought it was a good performance, but it was all up to the judges, and they had to simply wait and see.\n\n\"We had a really high score of 89 out of 100 which is our best score all season, they hit the best routine by far,\" said Narragansett head cheer coach Megan Hazelton.\n\nAs awards began, Narragansett huddled together on the mat, holding one another's hands with their heads down and eyes closed. It was the typical ritual for an awards ceremony, but this was the ultimate stage. Finally, the Warriors heard their name come over the speaker and the moment they had been working for since the fall had come.\n\nMore: Best of lacrosse: Four Oakmont, Monty Tech games to mark on your calendars\n\nThey were bringing home Narragansett's first-ever national title in cheer. They not only won their division, they were announced once again as the grand national champions, boasting the highest score out of all teams at the competition. It was the highest accolade for the championship.\n\n\"This is one of the best things I have ever done with my life - become a coach,\" said assistant cheer coach Gabby O'Malley. \"I have coached some of the most amazing children.\"\n\n\"Genuinely this team, I have never been more proud of a team of athletes that I've coached. These kids made Gansett history and that's not done every day.\"\n\nThe announcers called out \"Nagaransett,\" mispronouncing the school's name and confusing the girls for a moment, but they quickly all realized it was them who had won and broke into celebration.\n\n\"It was really crazy to hear our names being called first, there were so many great teams there... it's something I have always wanted to accomplish and something my team has always wanted to accomplish,\" senior Kasey Lovewell said.\n\nAfter a rollercoaster of a season - struggling in the fall to find their team chemistry, changing the entirety of their routine and perfecting it over the course of the winter - the Warriors can finally take a breath. However, the breath of relief didn't last long, as the next thing they had to do was say goodbye to the seniors and O'Malley.\n\nMore: Senior leadership and team bond helps Quabbin tennis to undefeated start to season\n\nThere wasn't a dry eye in the room as the five seniors - Lovewell, Ava Lyskawa, Madison Philbin, Jillian O'Malley and Gabby Warren - gathered together over the cheer mats, doing the annual \"signing off\". On the back of the mats, they wrote their farewell messages along with their signatures as their teammates watched on with tears streaming down their faces.\n\n\"I'm just really happy that we completed what we wanted to do, especially what I said last time, all we wanted to do was make everyone proud and we went above and beyond with that and that's probably the best thing I could possibly ask for,\" said Lyskawa, feeling the bittersweet moment.\n\n\"It's just so crazy it's hard to articulate how we feel, it was our life for so long and now we did the dang thing!\" Philbin exclaimed.",

        "body": "Chennai (Tamil Nadu) [India], April 29 (ANI): Following the match-winning spell against SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024, Chennai Super Kings (CSK) right-arm seamer Tushar Despande said that his main plan was to maintain patience against the SRH batters.\n\nThe defending champions, CSK, returned to winning ways at Chepauk with a 78-run triumph over Pat Cummins-led SRH on Sunday in the ongoing IPL 2024.\n\nThe 28-year-old bowler asserted that the five-time champion has a specific plan and the team was focused on their plans even when the SRH batters were hitting them for a boundary or a six.\n\n\"When we came to bowl, the only plan was to have patience against SRH who are quite aggressive in the powerplay and that paid dividends for us. Bowling that length in the powerplay is crucial, even if I get hit, I always challenge the batter to hit that length again and it worked for me today. The ground was soaking wet, it swung for a couple of balls and then it did not. It was a bit sticky and I thought we used the pitch well. We had a specific plan - even if they hit a good ball, we will focus on our plans and not get carried away by them,\" Despande said in the post-match presentation.\n\nComing to the match, half-centuries from skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad (98 in 54 balls, with 10 fours and three sixes), Daryl Mitchell (52 in 32 balls, with seven fours and a six) and a fine cameo by Shivam Dube (39 in 20 balls, with a four and four sixes) powered CSK to 212/3 in their 20 overs.\n\nIn the run-chase of 213, only Aiden Markram (32 in 26 balls, with four boundaries) and Heinrich Klaasen (20 in 21 balls, with a six) could touch the 20-run mark. They were skittled out for 134 in 18.5 overs, with Tushar Deshpande (4/27), Matheesha Pathirana (2/17) and Mustafizur Rahman (2/19) being the pick of the bowlers.\n\nGaikwad took home the 'Player of the Match' award for his knock.\n\nCSK is at number three with five wins and four losses, giving them 10 points. SRH is at the fourth spot with five wins and four losses, giving them 10 points. (ANI)",

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nMax Verstappen's dominance of Formula One must be \"celebrated and not chastised\", former team boss Otmar Szafnauer has said.\n\nRed Bull's Verstappen is on course to take his fourth world championship in as many seasons after winning four of the opening five rounds so far.\n\nBut speaking ahead of this weekend's Miami Grand Prix, Szafnauer, who served as team principal at Aston Martin and Alpine, said: \"You can't get rid of Max. The sport has gone through this before. Max will not be champion forever, and it will change.\n\n\"We have had Michael (Schumacher) and Lewis (Hamilton) dominating in the past, and we have to celebrate Max for his brilliance and not chastise him for winning all the time.\"\n\nThere are fears within the sport that Verstappen's stranglehold could drive F1's new Netflix fanbase away.\n\nHowever, American Szafnauer believes a fourth race in the United States - to follow Miami, Las Vegas and Austin - could be integral in preventing interest from waning.\n\nHe continued: \"It is amazing what Netflix and the combination of three races in America has done over there.\n\n\"I have friends from Florida who are visiting and one of my friends' friends said his daughter, who is 17, saw a picture of me recently and said, 'wow, do you know him?' And that is the Netflix effect. Without Netflix, she might not have known that Formula One existed.\n\n\"What we have to do is keep those fans interested. You don't want to lose them, and if Max is winning all the time, will that happen?\n\n\"At the Canadian Grand Prix last year, the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell spoke to all the team principals. The thing he said is you have to capitalise, and keep the fans and grow it, and he is right.\n\n\"But how do you keep them and grow it? Maybe a fourth race in America. Make it a destination race in New York or the West Coast and it will work. Miami is a destination race. Vegas is, and Austin is, too. Can there be four races in the States? I think so.\"\n\nSzafnauer - speaking in his role as chairman of EventR, his newly-launched app that he believes is set to revolutionise the way sports teams manage the logistics of group travel to major events - also urged Red Bull team principal Christian Horner to retain the services of Sergio Perez who is out of contract at the end of the season.\n\nSzafnauer, who worked with Perez at Force India and then Racing Point before the Mexican joined Red Bull in 2021, said: \"I was asked on stage recently, 'if you are Christian Horner, who would you replace Checo (Perez) with?' And I replied saying, 'knowing Checo as well as I do, I would replace Checo with Checo. I would keep him'.\n\n\"Let's not forget, Max won his first championship, partly because of the circumstances, but partly because of Checo, too (when he held off Hamilton in Abu Dhabi). That is when he earned the nickname in Mexico as the 'Minister of Defence'.\n\n\"He's had some lows. But from what I can see this year, apart from a couple of races where I think he should have finished a bit higher, I think he's doing it.\"",

        "title": "Did Mikel Arteta let Spurs get close just to prove a point about Arsenal?",
        "body": "Arsenal were too casual and then they showed some gumption at last. What a match. Plus, some views on Salah, City and more.\n\nGosh, what a match!\n\nIf ever you wanted proof that we are not THAT Arsenal team anymore, there you are. It's almost like Mikel wanted them to get close just to prove a point.\n\nAdam (Happy saint T's day 😘) gooner in France\n\nIt was a weird game, although not quite the one-sided onslaught for Spurs that Gary Neville was trying to tell us it was when it was 0-3. Spurs should've scored through Romero and then of course did score through Van De Ven. It was very tight and honestly, if they'd have said onside I'm not sure we could've argued it. But, as ever, that euphoric high of a crowd thinking it was 1-1 played a massive part in us being 2-0 to the good so soon after. The psychological impact VAR decisions has is so huge and I'm convinced it played a part here. Again.\n\nI'm not moaning; the second an absolutely brilliant breakaway. Firstly, neither piece of contact is a penalty and I find it rich Spurs fans accusing Saka of diving in a key spot not a month ago are so aghast at today's non-decision. But after that, the intricate play, Havertz's vision and pass, before Saka's impeccable first touch. It was, by quite some distance, my moment of the season in a season of great moments.\n\nAgain, the commentary did it no justice, with Neville focusing on what could've happen as opposed to what did. Honestly, the price of a subscription is a joke at this point. Then we exploited them from another set piece. Is there a push? Possibly. Is it soft? Relatively. Way to look at it is: would it be a penalty the other way? No.\n\nSecond half I honestly felt like we were in total control, with the period between half time and the 63rd minute probably our best spell and it felt like a fourth was coming. Vicario made an incredible save from Saka, but our overall play just felt so controlled. My little one was making faces from the garden at me and I was making them back - that is not normal NLD behaviour.\n\nAnd then Raya Ramsdale'd and everything changed. Without that moment, I think the post-match discourse is very different. It was completely unnecessary and really far too casual, sort of summing up how the game was going at that point.\n\nAs expected, the crowd got back behind Spurs and there can be no complaints about the penalty they did get. Michael Oliver not giving it first time is poor, but I'm not sure about the Spurs fans screaming CORRUPTION when VAR rightly called him to the screen to overturn it, which he did after a single replay.\n\nUltimately, we got the three points, which was the only thing that mattered. At 3-0, we should've seen it out differently, but we didn't and hopefully we (Raya!!) learn from it.\n\nAnd then City won anyway, so none of it will probably end up mattering!!\n\nThree to go.\n\nJoe, AFC, East Sussex\n\nREAD: 16 Conclusions from Spurs 2-3 Arsenal: Stupidity, set-pieces, perfect outcomes and inverted centre-backs\n\nIs Declan Rice a villain of yesterday's game for giving away a penalty by kicking a Spuds player in his spuds, or is he a hero for kicking a Spuds player in his Spuds more generally?\n\nAnswers on a postcard!\n\nGooner who wishes Arsenal wouldn't be on TV at my child's bedtime, Dubai\n\nIt's written in the VARS\n\nTo manufacture the 'best league in the world', a little scripting is needed. Keep it exciting, down to the last point. Liverpool fell off, but here's a new challenger Arsenal and every bit of help was offered to make sure the 'excitement' go down to the wire.\n\nSpurs were not allowed to score (VAR offsided their goal), were not allowed a pen (Kulu) and were blocked off illegally by Arsenal players (Vicario) and thus, it was written in the VARS, that Arsenal will win at Spurs away to maintain the title challenge.\n\nPlease tell me fans did not see through that.\n\nMeanwhile, real excitement is happening in the Bundesliga, in La Liga, in Serie A, even the Eredivisie with the regular winners falling off and a new world order coming to play. Their excitement is real, authentic, and something the Premier League is trying to bring in after allowing cheat code Chelsea and Man City into the League.\n\nYou reap what you sow, and until the financial playing field is leveled out for skills and luck to triumph, there will always be these glitches in English football matches that does not seem real.\n\nVinnie Pee\n\nIf you poke the tiger...\n\nCity fan here. I have often read on here that the current City team are a 'soulless machine.' Well, back in the day, when United were in their pomp, I remember, all too painfully, what it was like watching them. Whilst we were, more often than not, fighting against relegation, they were playing every game as though they had an extra player on the pitch.\n\nEvery team raised their game against them because, you know, it was United. But even then they, seemingly, always found a way to win.\n\nOur biggest game in those years was the derby. It certainly wasn't for United. They had far bigger fish to fry with the likes of Liverpool, Arsenal, and Chelsea. In the rare event we scored first in the derby, I always had the feeling of \"Oh sh*t. We've just poked a sleeping tiger with a sharp stick.\" And all too often, that view would prove correct.\n\nAnd that, folks, is Manchester City circa 2024. The Manchester derby has interest for City fans solely for bragging rights in the City itself. They are not a threat. Liverpool and Arsenal, are.\n\nForest yesterday were excellent. They had some 15 shots on target against City's 10. They didn't take them. And if failing to take your chances is not the essence of football, then what is?\n\nMake a mistake? This City team will punish you. Score first? You've just poked the tiger.\n\nSoulless? Not on your Nelly. Machine? Absolutely.\n\nMark (I said it last week and I'll say it again. This PL ain't over 'till my ex-wife starts to sing). MCFC\n\nHistory tells us Slot could fail at Liverpool\n\nPaul says that because Liverpool successfully handed the reigns over 40 years ago that means it can happen today.\n\nWhich is mostly wrong.\n\nFirstly those were the exception to the rule. Since then: Souness failed to succeed Kenny, Evans failed to succeed Souness. Houllier then did a great job for three years before successfully being replaced by Rafa. Rafa was then succeeded by Hodgson, Kenny again, Rodgers before being (somewhat) successfully replaced by Jürgen.\n\nThat's 5 times (out of 7) since the glory years in which we have failed to find the right guy and watch him succeed at the club. And it's not just this club either, it's happened at United, Arsenal, Newcastle (Souness again following a Liverpool legend in Keegan), Real Madrid, Barcelona, Milan, Juventus...\n\nHistory tells us you are more likely to succeed when there is little to no expectations and the higher the expectations go the less successful you will get. It's what makes the truly special managers like Ancelotti, Fergie, Sacchi, del Bosque really great. They handle the pressure and do even better.\n\nWe also have to consider that all those coming from the famous bootroom did it in a time of less publicity, and when the public had no voice beyond singing at matches. Much as you might not like to admit it, from a pressure standpoint it was easier back then than now.\n\nI want to be optimistic about Slot, his record is pretty good; though we should temper that by also saying it's a record in a league where Steve McLaren took FC Twente to a league win over Ajax and PSV as well. Steve McLaren is now assistant manager to the last Dutch coach out of Holland...Ten Hg. Also there hasn't actually been a single successful Dutch coach since Cruyff. They tend to be decent cup managers and not much else.\n\nSympathy not hate\n\nWhilst there is a smorgasbord of ways to unpick the latest version of the same email Calvinho writes on a bi-weekly basis, which basically boils down to 'why can't everyone say the same thing that I think about my club because they are the biggest and bestest', the fact that he wrote the following line without even a hint of irony is a remarkable achievement.\n\nI find this is a result from our modern tribalism, social media algorithms favoring negativity and toxicity, but also as a channel for football fans to direct their rage.\n\nThe reason you believe all stories are about Man Utd is because of your echo chamber. Last week the big story was the Forest penalty refereegate - nothing to do with Man Utd. Today I wake up to 1) Chelsea's disallowed winner, 2) Anthony Taylor randomly stopping play, 3) Klopp/Salah spat - again none of them Man Utd. I don't even see any stories about Andre Onana punching someone in the head for what feels like the 4th time this season.\n\nBut on the point of 'hate'. I assumed that people had moved beyond the hate of the 90's and 00's.\n\nThe feel now is just hilarity - that the vast majority of decisions in the last 10 years have been disastrous. That the once great team that walked over all opponents are now routinely outplayed by inferior teams.\n\nAnd dare I say it, is sympathy making an appearance? Sympathy that they do not seem to have any competent football people behind the scenes, Sympathy that the dead man walking manager comes up with new ways to make himself look silly after the latest subpar performance, Sympathy that the new goalkeeper drops at least one clanger a game, sympathy for having to watch Antony, sympathy for the defensive injuries (ok that one is genuine), sympathy for the forlorn hope that sir big Jim and the (in no way of a result of dubious methods) cycling genius will immediately turn the tide despite being bound by PSR.\n\nJ Belfast (pitied, adored, sometimes ignored, sometimes not)\n\nAn England XI for the Euros\n\nGiven the Euros are starting in around 6-7 weeks, I am sure Southgate has an idea of what his starting line up will be, and truthfully apart from defence, he could field two different teams upfront and in midfield. He isn't short of options at all in that aspect, but has to pick the most effective and tactical team if England want to reach the final again.\n\nGK: Pickford - Quite self explanatory, Ramsdale isn't even playing currently and Pope been injured all season.\n\nRB: Walker - Will possibly be his last major tournament with England, but he is the best RB for England and the Premier League currently (Can't say I blame Ben White for choosing to stay at home if he is just going to be on the bench all the time.)\n\nCB: Maguire - He has tournament experience and has somehow been United's best defender this season (Which says it all about United really). He could definitely have a clanger or two if playing against a top side, but reliable for England nonetheless, no better option currently.\n\nCB: Stones - Very important he stays fit, quite possibly the most important defender for England.\n\nLB: Gomez - Honestly, I can't think of anyone else, both Chilwell & Shaw are made of glass and Tripper is past his best too.\n\nCM: Rice - No real explanation needed, he seems to be getting better and better and developing his game very well at Arsenal. Possibly England's most important player after Kane.\n\nCM: Trent Alexander Arnold - May as well pop him into midfield now right? He can't defend for shit, but can shoot and pass pretty bloody well. If Southgate plays someone like Henderson or Gallagher, really have no sympathy for him if it all goes tits up (Only other CM who should be considered is Ward Prowse, but maybe too slow to play in a major tournament)\n\nCAM: Bellingham - I was thinking he could play deeper for England, but honestly I think it would be a waste and he is currently linking the midfield and attack so well for Madrid. His performances in this similar position have been World Class and is on course in winning three trophies for Madrid this season, and practically has La Liga secured making that two trophies in his first season at the club.\n\nLW: Grealish/Foden - Now the reason I say Grealish is because tactically I think he is smarter than people give him credit for. There must be a reason Pep is playing in LW in some of the bigger games for City, but Foden is a much better player overall and can add more for England than Grealish, I suppose it depends on the opposition, but given both these wingers play for City, both are as good as each other for England when fit.\n\nRW: Saka - He has a combined total of 33 goals & assists in all competitions for Arsenal this season, played very well for Arsenal in the UCL this season and could still win the League title. Palmer has definitely stood out for Chelsea, but Chelsea are a midtable team and are shocking. Palmer is certainly unlucky not to start, but he will be on the plane to he Euro's and he would be a bloody great impact player off the bench if one of the wingers or Bellingham is having a stinker.\n\nST - Kane - He can clearly play in any team in the world, he just knows how to score goals and provide assists for the team as well, but unfortunately the man is cursed. Watkins won't ever start if Kane is fit.\n\nAs a United fan, it pains me that the only England player in this line up is Maguire. How times have changed! Shaw and Rashford have bits of quality, but unfortunately one is always injured and the other is just very lazy and overrated as well. Rashford is a good impact player off the bench, but England now have better options than him in Palmer, Watkins and yeah probably Grealish as well.\n\nRami, Dubai\n\nOn the Salah shenanigans\n\nSalah is a great play maker and scorer. He needs intelligent players around him like the departing Firmino , Sadio Mane and Henderson among others. Unfortunately the club went for inexpensive replacements. And in my opinion, this is the reason behind the manager departure.\n\nCarmen\n\n...Hey Mo, you were a football journeyman up until Klopp took you under his wing, he changed you, he made you the footballer you are now, how DARE you disrespect him especially in public. You have no right to disrespect him behind closed doors.\n\nNobody cares about the facts\n\nAs much as some of us appreciate the PSR and City breakdown, people here don't care. Football fans in general don't care. They want to know who are the good guys and who are bad guys and that's it basically. Due process and the rest are boring and complicated and that is not a world that they want to live in.\n\nFrankly, reading Mailbox these days with the type of unbelievable delusional arrogance displayed by Calvino and Rich AFC yesterday is just tedious. Apparently one thinks the entire world revolves around the football club he coincidentally supports. The other who supports the 4th richest club in the entire country (out of tens of thousands of clubs) who joined the Super League and asks that the current Champions go and join the Super League because he's bored of losing.\n\nThese are not normal and rational people. Football is not a hobby here, it's a channel for the impotent rage that they feel in their lives.\n\nToday I read a post from the top Liverpool forum with a long term well respected member claiming that he hopes there's a terrorist attack on the Etihad because his football team will probably not win a league title this year. Social media manages to be even worse than that.\n\nIf City are cleared yet again, which would be the 4th time now, people will call them cheats because its not about evidence, it's not about process, it's not about \"the soul of football\" (and certainly fans of PL teams are certainly not the ones who can lecture anyone upon that), it's\n\njust politics by another name. Some people wear the same colour tie as me and that means that everything they say is correct and just and right and competent and some people wear a different colour ties and that means everything they say is wrong and evil and grotesque and they're attempting to kill everything that I love.\n\nThis site used to mock these type of people but somehow has become part of the problem over the years.\n\nPaul, Manchester",
