        "body": "Sandvik Rock Processing is introducing its upgraded 800i cone crusher series. A major talking point is the new ACS-c 5 automation and connectivity system, which integrates the capabilities of all of Sandvik's crusher modules and subsystems into a single automation system.\n\nThe upgraded Sandvik 800i cone crusher series is now available globally, effective March 1, 2024, confirms Nils-Peter Ahlqvist, Sales Support Manager, Africa & Latin America - Crushing Division at Sandvik Rock Processing.\n\n\"The Sandvik 800i cone crusher range's combination of high crushing forces, reliability and simplicity make it easier to operate, manage, maintain and service, resulting in productivity and uptime gains that are gamechangers for operational performance,\" says Ahlqvist.\n\nThe latest Sandvik 800i crushers with new ACS-c 5 combine simple, yet robust mechanical design with powerful user-friendly automation to better support diverse operational roles. The new role-based interaction functionality simplifies the work of operators, maintenance personnel and engineers by offering guidance, access to valuable data and tools for proactive maintenance and optimisation.\n\nThe ACS-c 5 automation system guides the operator through alarms and recommended actions, streamlining the decision-making process during alerts and minimising the impact of potential issues.\n\n\"Maintenance personnel have access to an improved historical and operational data log, providing a comprehensive overview of the crusher's performance. The new automation system offers engineers more opportunities to monitor, analyse and optimise the crusher's performance,\" explains Adam Taylor, Business Line Manager Crushing Solutions - Africa at Sandvik Rock Processing.\n\nWith sustainability in mind, the upgraded Sandvik 800i crushers are designed to eliminate inefficiency in operating mines, as well as in greenfields operations. For example, in flowsheets including three-stage crushing and conventional grinding, these crushers assist SAG/AG circuits with pebble-crushing and optimise particle size distribution for lump ores and heap leach applications. The Sandvik 800i crushers are also suitable in high pressure grinding roll (HPGR) circuits. They crush more and deliver finer particle sizes to the downstream processes.\n\n\"With the latest 800i crushers, we are able to produce much finer product (down to mill feeds of sub 6 mm) from our crushing and screening circuits, ultimately resulting in improved milling and overall process performance. This translates into less energy consumed and reduced wear in downstream processes. In other words, we allow customers to 'crush more to grind less',\" says Ahlqvist.\n\nThe upgraded Sandvik 800i crushers are ready to be connected to the SAM by Sandvik cloud-based digital assistant. SAM collects information from all connected Sandvik equipment to provide a complete overview of the entire operation. Customers can look at the status of their connected equipment, communicate across teams, view alerts and notifications, pro-actively order spare parts, and much more.\n\n\"With the new SAM mobile app for iOS and Android, customers can have an overview of their crushing fleet, monitor equipment data and key parameters, receive alarms from the ACS system directly in their pocket and get recommended actions created to help them solve issues more quickly,\" concludes Ahlqvist.",

        "body": "The arrival of modern televisions loaded with applications has brought home another device that we have to worry about. And it is essential to ensure that the applications that give you all the potential are updated to access the latest features and improve the security and stability of these apps.\n\nIn the case of Android TV/Google TV, the number of applications available on the official google store it's huge. We can have applications on different devices and in order to get more out of them, it is a good idea for them to be synchronized. And this is how I have done it from my mobile.\n\nThe applications can be installed manually by the user, but it is best do it in a way automatic. In this way, when synchronizing a phone or tablet or any other device, when we download an app on the mobile it will also be downloaded on those devices that we choose.\n\nThis is a help for who uses different devices with Android or Android TV up to date, whether mobile phones, tablets, Smart TV, a Chromecast. The idea is that the apps update themselves. This option allows us that when we download an app in question, it will be downloaded and installed on several of our devices, such as other mobile phones, tablets or TVs.\n\nTo proceed to synchronize the applications automatically on the chosen devices using the mobile. You have to enter Play Store on your phone and open the menu by clicking on the profile icon and then enter \"Manage apps and device\" and search \"Sync App with devices\"\n\nIn practice, what this does is that if we download an application from device A, it will also be downloaded to device B, that is, as long as it is compatible and without us having to do anything special about it. It is useful if you want to have several devices with the same apps.\n\nIn Xataka SmartHome | This way you can make better use of your Smart TV with Android TV/Google TV and without paying anything. The secret is open source apps",

Android 15 is going to bring another layer of optimisation for dark modes, and this time, you could also see the colours change for apps that are not supporting the mode.\n\nThe latest Android 15 beta code hints at a super dark mode feature that will turn all the apps on your phone into black/grey colour.\n\nYou might have noticed this issue with Android 14 where even the system default dark mode doesn't work on all apps, which makes the whole interface look weird. But Android 15 could finally give apps a uniform look, as spotted by tipster Mishaal Rehman in his latest findings.\n\nThere are many apps that still don't support dark mode (no idea why) but Android 15 will finally fix the issue and ensure the apps or the UI doesn't look jarring. The report claims Android 15 will use a different algorithm which will ensure that the 'make all apps dark' mode work effectively and you won't need third-party dark mode apps to make it happen in the near future.\n\nThe tipster also shows some of the non-supported apps switching to dark mode on Android 15 beta but we'll probably have to wait a while before the official details are shared by Google which should happen at the I/O 2024 keynote next month.\n\nThe first set of phones to get Android 15 update will be the Pixel series, followed by brands like Samsung, OnePlus and more. It is high time that dark mode works universally across apps which has not happened since we saw the feature make its debut in 2019 when Android 10 version was rolled out.",

        "body": "Experience enhanced efficiency as Google Play Store introduces simultaneous app downloads for Android users.\n\nGoogle Play Store has unveiled a highly anticipated update, allowing users to download two apps concurrently, promising a more efficient experience for Android users. This development comes amidst the platform's ongoing transformations, including recent integrations of AI-generated FAQs for app listings. While users could previously download only one app at a time, this latest update marks a significant shift in functionality. Reports from 9to5Google and Android Police indicate that the feature is already available on various devices, including Pixel smartphones running version 40.6.31 of the Google Play Store.\n\nDespite the excitement surrounding this update, there are certain limitations to consider. Currently, users are limited to downloading two apps simultaneously, with additional downloads queued as pending until space becomes available. Initial leaks had suggested a more generous allowance of up to five simultaneous downloads, hinting at potential adjustments in the future. However, one area that remains unchanged is app updates, as the Google Play Store continues to process updates one at a time. Many users eagerly anticipate the inclusion of simultaneous update downloads, which would further enhance convenience.\n\nGoogle's efforts to implement multi-app downloading have been ongoing since 2019, reflecting the company's commitment to improving user experience continually. To check if this feature is available on your Android device, attempt to download two or more sizable apps or games simultaneously. Additionally, users may need to ensure that newly downloaded apps appear on the home screen, a setting that can be adjusted on Google Pixel phones via Home Settings> Add app icons to the home screen. With this latest update, Google Play Store users can look forward to a smoother and more efficient downloading experience on their Android devices.",

        "body": "In today's globalized world, effective communication across languages is more crucial than ever. Whether you're traveling to a foreign country, learning a new language, or engaging in international business, the ability to understand and be understood is paramount. Fortunately, Android language translation apps have emerged as essential tools to help bridge these language gaps. Among the most notable and widely used apps are Google Translate and Microsoft Translator. This article delves into the features and functionalities of these apps, guiding you to select the best option for your specific translation needs.\n\nAndroid translation apps offer a range of features designed to make translation quick, easy, and accessible. Here are some of the key features you can expect:\n\nWhile the basic features of Android translation apps are impressive, some apps offer advanced functionalities that set them apart:\n\nWith various Android translation apps available, each with its own strengths, choosing the right one depends on your specific needs. If you're a frequent traveler or often handle multilingual documents, an app with robust camera-based text translation and offline capabilities may be ideal. On the other hand, if your primary need involves verbal interactions in various languages, prioritize apps with effective real-time speech translation and audio output features.\n\nIt's worth noting that while these apps are incredibly useful, they are not perfect substitutes for human translators. For critical or nuanced communication, such as legal documents or sensitive business negotiations, professional translation services remain the gold standard.\n\nIn summary, Android language translation apps like Google Translate and Microsoft Translator are powerful aids in surmounting language obstacles. They offer a spectrum of features suited to diverse needs, from straightforward text translations to sophisticated real-time conversational translations. By understanding the capabilities and limitations of these apps, you can select the tool that best aligns with your requirements. Whether for personal travel, language learning, or professional interactions, these apps equip you with the necessary tools to communicate more seamlessly and efficiently across languages in our increasingly interconnected world.",

        "body": "The change will improve security for many users, though you should still maintain basic security hygiene on shared devices.\n\nAndroid TV devices, even those running the Google TV layer on top, have a security oversight that exposes practically all of your Google account data if someone has access to your TV with a signed-in Google account. It's actually intended behavior for Android, but it's a security oversight for a form factor that isn't always used in absolutely personal and private environments and doesn't have further security protections. Google mentioned that it had fixed the oversight, and now, there are more details on what has changed.",
