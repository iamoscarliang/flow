        "title": "P.E.I. farmer worries stray voltage is harming his cattle",
        "body": "WARNING: Some may find this story contains distressing photos or content\n\nIt started with calf number 123.\n\n\"He was perfectly fine and drinking on a cow,\" said John Gallant, who owns beef cattle on his third-generation farm in St. Timoth√©e, P.E.I., near Wellington.\n\nHe jumped on his tractor and was backing out when he saw something strange.\n\n\"The calf was laying pretty much lined up with the side of this fence post in the middle of a water puddle there, stiff as a board with his eyes rolled behind his head.\"\n\nGallant said he sprung into action -- pulling the calf out of the puddle and onto dry land. To his surprise, it jumped to its feet and ran away.\n\nBut then \"he started flopping on the ground and bounced up again and ran another 100 feet and did the same thing.\"\n\nOther unusual things were going on, too. What he calls \"scorched burn marks\" appeared on some of his cows' backs. His calves showed similar spots around their ears, nose and eyes.\n\nGallant says the phenomenon is causing burn marks on his cattle and their nails are falling off. (John Gallant)\n\nGallant thinks what's happening is something known as stray voltage, and he feels his cattle were \"getting electrocuted out in an open field.\"\n\n\"My very first phone call to Maritime Electric was: 'My cattle are in a frying pan, it's time to turn down the heat,'\" he said.\n\n'Cattle are especially sensitive'\n\nAside from Gallant's allegations and his own personal testing with equipment, including an ammeter that measures electrical currents, there is no evidence that these incidents are specifically caused by electricity.\n\nBut an expert says stray voltage on farms is possible.\n\nAccording to Ian Nokes, who researches how energy impacts farms with the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, stray voltage -- also known as tingle voltage -- happens when an unwanted electrical current moves from one spot to another.\n\nHe said one of the first steps is figuring out where it's coming from: Maritime Electric's system or equipment on the farm like faulty wiring or something that isn't properly grounded and leaking current.\n\n\"When this current is flowing through the ground, it wants to go anywhere it can to get back to the source,\" he said.\n\n\"Cattle are especially sensitive to this.\"\n\nCalf number 123 is now doing better since moving off of Gallant's farm with the rest of his herd. (Sheehan Desjardins/CBC News)\n\nNokes said in Ontario it's considered an issue if the stray current exceeds one volt. Although he can't comment on Gallant's situation specifically, he said he has seen tingle voltage \"devastate\" farmers.\n\n\"You can imagine the stress and the mental anguish when you just see these animals suffering can be astronomical. Financially, you know, people lose whole herds \" he said.\n\n\"It's tricky because the symptoms the cattle is expressing, you're not going to think right away, 'Well it's getting tingle voltage.'\"\n\nMaritime Electric investigates\n\nGallant said Maritime Electric has been to his property a few times since he contacted them. But he said the issue continues.\n\nMaritime Electric did not provide an interview but did send an emailed statement that said it \"takes all customer safety concerns seriously and has had its Engineering and Operations teams complete a thorough investigation into this matter.\"\n\nGallant said one night the power was off for about 40 minutes while the utility was doing work. When the lights came back on, he said he had three animals collapse within 45 minutes -- one died a few days later.\n\nGallant turned off the power in his barn and hasn't turned it back on since.\n\n\"I have gotten three electrical shocks inside the barn,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not something that's a big jolt and a spark and everything goes boom and everything's all over. It is something that is very slow. It starts off with nothing but a slight little tingle at the tip of a finger.\"\n\nGallant has been doing his own testing with an ammeter to try and solve the problem. (John Gallant)\n\nBut according to Maritime Electric, \"the findings have concluded that all the Company's equipment, including the neutral current and voltage readings on Maritime Electric's power line at or near the customer's property are operating within the requirements set out by the Canadian Standards Association and in the Canadian Electrical Code.\"\n\nRingworm, frostbite, neglect? Vet says no\n\nGallant is aware his theory might seem far-fetched and knows people might wonder if what is impacting his cattle could be something else like ringworm, frostbite, the feed he uses, or even neglect.\n\nBut one of his veterinarians, Dr. Wade Sweet, said although he can't confirm it's due to electricity, he doesn't think it's any of those other things either.\n\n\"I've worked with John for years. He runs the community pasture. He knows how to feed animals and his feed quality is excellent. He's not mistreating his animals,\" said Sweet.\n\n\"In the fall, they were all in excellent condition ... there just seems to be something that we can't quite define with his animals.\"\n\nVeterinarian Dr. Wade Sweet says Gallant is a good farmer and takes good care of his cattle. (Sheehan Desjardins/CBC News)\n\nGallant's pasture is now empty. Sweet recommended he move his cattle to another location off his farm until the electrical issues are investigated.\n\n\"It brought back all the memories of my childhood, of what we experienced in that barn over there.\"\n\nThe barn Gallant is pointing to is empty these days. Growing up, it's where the family milked dairy cows. But he said his family sold them all in 1992 \"because we couldn't keep healthy animals year-round in that barn.\"\n\nGallant said this has been an issue before. A CBC P.E.I. story done that same year shows an electrical engineer at Gallant's farm doing tests for stray voltage and speaking with other farmers about the issue.\n\nGallant says the situation in his barn has happened before when his family owned dairy cows in 1992. (Sheehan Desjardins/CBC News)\n\nThree years ago, Gallant bought beef cattle hoping things would be different.\n\n\"I have no words. I simply have no words,\" he said. \"This is absurd and it's not new. That's the biggest part of my issue right now. We screamed about this a long time ago.\"\n\nStill wants answers\n\nIn its statement Maritime Electric said, \"We have encouraged the customer to engage a qualified electrician to investigate any potential electrical or grounding issues associated with the customer-owned equipment and buildings on his property.\"\n\nThe provincial government declined to comment, saying it would defer to Maritime Electric.\n\nHis pasture now sits empty, but Gallant knows he'll have to bring his cattle back to the farm at some point. (Sheehan Desjardins/CBC News)\n\nFor now, Gallant said his cattle appear to be improving in their temporary home. He knows they can't stay there forever though, and he worries about his family who are still living on the property.\n\n\"If I can't have cows again on this property, I can find another job but I can't move out of my house,\" he said.\n\nGallant thinks his cows are doing better and their wounds are improving after being moved off of his farm. (Sheehan Desjardins/CBC News)\n\nStill, he knows stray voltage is hard to prove and he is hoping to find an expert who can help.\n\n\"It's something that can't be seen [and] unless you get electrocuted it can't be felt. But the cows can't lie,\" he said.\n\n\"This is an issue that needs to be resolved immediately. It needs to be dissected and figured out what is wrong and let's get on this because nobody should be living in these conditions.\"",

        "body": "Social media apps are seen on a mobile phone. (Photo by Chris McGrath/Getty Images)\n\nOhio senators have passed a bill to limit cell phone use in schools, but it allows local districts to decide on the best practices for their students.\n\n\"Being a parent in the age of smartphones is -- my mom would say is harder than she had it,\" Natalie Hastings, mom-of-two, said.\n\nHastings believes boundaries with technology are important, but there are struggles when it comes to school.\n\n\"There was some bullying in the restrooms and people were taking videos,\" she said. \"There is now a policy in place at the building level where kids can bring their phones to school and power them off, put them in their backpacks.\"\n\nStarting in the fall of 2023, a new policy at Akron Public Schools requires all secondary students to keep their cell phones in magnetically locking \"Yondr\" bags. Students are allowed to use their phones in the lunchroom and between classes but must silence and stow them away.\n\nSchools around the state have started cracking down on phone usage, and state lawmakers are joining in.\n\n\"I thought the idea of eliminating use of smartphones during the school day is a great idea,\" Senate President Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said.\n\nHuffman and his members just passed House Bill 250, legislation that added a provision to require each public school district to create a cell phone policy, emphasizing that phone use should be as limited as possible during the school day.\n\nThe legislation would also require the Department of Education and Workforce to adopt a model policy on student phone use that public schools could utilize. These policies come at a request of Gov. Mike DeWine, who said in his State of the State Address that phones are \"detrimental to our kids' mental health and they need to be removed from the classroom.\"\n\nHastings is mainly supportive of the Senate's bill.\n\n\"I would advocate that every building principal is the one who can make the best decision for their specific kids,\" Hastings said.\n\nShe is worried about a competing version of policy -- H.B. 485, which would ban personal devices like cell phones, computers, headphones and smartwatches unless a teacher specifically allows it, there is an emergency, it is needed for healthcare or if a student has a learning disability and it is part of their accommodations.\n\nThe bill would require public schools to create an internet safety policy. The legislation also mandates grades 6-12 to have courses on the negative side of social media.\n\nBut it isn't clear if House Speaker Jason Stephens (R-Kitts Hill) is on board with the Senate.\n\nThere were some questions in our caucus on what the details were on the cell phone language and we had several members who wanted to read those languages,\" Stephens said.\n\nState Rep. Tom Young (R-Washington Township), the sponsor of H.B. 485, wasn't thrilled with the Senate's actions.\n\n\"They have every right to do that, of course, however, we will have hearings on my bill because it's important that we get feedback from the districts and those interested parties so that we can have best practices and that's really important.\" Young said. \"Citizens should have a right to speak about a piece of legislation -- period -- especially one that's important. If we're going to do this then we're going to do it right.\"\n\nHastings said Ohio should start small before major mandates.\n\n\"It's a level of distraction that we are still figuring out in real time,\" she said.\n\nThe Senate's version goes back to the House for a concurrence vote.",

        "title": "Britain 'not in business' of taking more migrants, warns Mel Stride",
        "body": "Britain is \"not in the business\" of taking more migrants, a Cabinet minister has warned Ireland after it vowed to send asylum seekers to the UK.\n\nMel Stride, the Work and Pensions Secretary, said he saw no reason why the UK should take back migrants from Ireland when the EU and France would not accept returns from Britain.\n\nThe row broke out after senior Irish ministers said they would draft emergency laws to send back refugees who had arrived from the UK to avoid being deported to Rwanda.\n\nLast week, Micheal Martin, the Irish deputy prime minister, said the UK's Rwanda policy was \"impacting on Ireland\" because people were \"fearful\" of staying in the UK and were seeking asylum in Ireland instead.\n\nSimon Harris, the Irish prime minister, has asked for proposals for a new law to be brought to his cabinet this week to pave the way for the return of migrants to the UK.\n\nHowever, Mr Stride said on Monday morning: \"We are not in the business of having more Channel migrants in the UK.\"\n\n\"We have a situation where people are coming across from France illegally. The French are not prepared to take back the illegal migrants. I don't see why we should have any different situation.\"\n\nHe added: \"There are going to be discussions between the Irish Government and ours. I very much doubt we are going to end up in a position where we are going to say: 'We are going to be taking anybody back'.\n\n\"Not least because when it comes to France and other EU countries, they are not in the business of taking people back either.\"\n\nThe row is expected to feature in talks on Monday between Mr Martin and UK Northern Ireland ministers Chris Heaton Harris and Steve Baker as part of the British-Irish intergovernmental conference in London.\n\nHelen McEntee, the Irish Justice Minister, has pulled out of the conference in London today in what was seen as a tit-for-tat following Home Secretary James Cleverly's decision to cancel their meeting yesterday. Home Office sources cited a diary clash.\n\nImmigration to Ireland rose by 32 per cent in the year ending last April, with asylum seekers accounting for more than 13,000 of over 140,000 arrivals. Irish ministers suggest that 80 per cent of the asylum seekers are crossing the border from the UK, and have cited the deterrence of Rwanda as a factor.\n\nMr Harris said on Sunday: \"Every country is entitled to have its own migration policy, but I certainly don't intend to allow anybody else's migration policy to affect the integrity of our own one.\n\n\"This country will not, in any way, shape or form, provide a loophole for anybody else's migration challenges. That's very clear.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Stride was unapologetic about the Rwanda policy. Asked if it was designed to force migrants into Ireland, he denied it was the case but said it was designed to act as a deterrent.\n\nHe said: \"The design is to ensure there is a deterrent effect. We passed the Rwanda Bill that means those coming here illegally can expect to be removed to Rwanda. What we are already seeing is a deterrent effect kicking in. That's why we are seeing people moving from the UK into Ireland.\"\n\nBefore Brexit, the return of migrants to EU countries was governed by the Dublin Agreement, under which migrants could be sent back to a safe third country through which they had passed before arriving at their destination.\n\nThis meant that asylum seekers arriving in Ireland from the UK, or migrants reaching the UK from France, could be returned if it could be shown that they had passed through a safe third country - that is, the UK or France.\n\nBut the UK left the scheme when it left the EU and no successor agreement was signed during the Brexit talks, meaning there are no formal returns agreements in place between EU countries and the UK.\n\nA post-Brexit provision was, however, made in the case of the UK and Ireland, which meant Ireland could return asylum seekers to Britain. No asylum seeker has been successfully returned to Ireland, or vice-versa, under this post-Brexit arrangement since it was struck.\n\nHowever, the Irish High Court last month ruled that the Irish government's declaration of the UK as a \"safe third country\" to which it could return asylum seekers was unlawful, owing to the Rwanda Bill. The emergency legislation proposal seeks to overturn this judgement.",

        "title": "What's the fuss over Froot Loops and red dye 40? Here's what you need to know about the possible ban.",
        "body": "On the heels of California passing a bill that bans red dye No. 3 from being sold in the state, legislators have introduced another bill targeting different food additives. An advancing bill called A.B. 2316 aims to remove red dye 40, along with five other food dyes and titanium dioxide, from food provided at schools in the state. The bill was written by Assembly member Jesse Gabriel, who authored the California Food Safety Act that banned red dye No. 3 in the state. Gabriel tells Yahoo Life that the inspiration for the latest bill came while he was working on the California Food Safety Act. \"We heard from parents across the country, asking us to do something about these dyes,\" he says, noting that yellow dye No. 5, yellow dye No. 6, blue dye No. 1, blue dye No. 2 and green dye No. 3 are under fire as well.\n\nGabriel says he \"grew up struggling with ADHD,\" and that one of his sons has the condition too. \"A lot of the science around these chemicals says that it can impact all children, but it can be particularly challenging for kids with ADHD,\" he says. \"It's crazy that we would have young people in our schools who are getting therapy to deal with their challenges and then at lunch, we're serving them food with chemicals that are undoing all of that good work.\"\n\nBut what foods are these dyes found in, and how concerning is this overall? Experts break it down.\n\nThe dyes being targeted can show up in a range of foods. \"These dyes are often found in many foods marketed to kids, such as candy, breakfast cereals, baked goods, ice cream and sports drinks,\" Gianfranco Cesareo, a law fellow specializing in food safety at the Environmental Working Group, tells Yahoo Life. \"However, they can also be present in less obvious products, like canned fruit and pickles.\"\n\nA few big-name products that contain these dyes include:\n\n\"These dyes are in all sorts of foods,\" Jamie Alan, an associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Michigan State University, tells Yahoo Life. \"Usually you will find them in processed foods.\"\n\nResearch findings on the dyes have been mixed, but there is a link between these food dyes and behavioral issues in some kids. A 2021 report conducted by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and published in 2021 analyzed data from human and animal studies and found that synthetic food dyes are associated with hyperactivity and poor neurobehavioral outcomes in children, although there is a range of how sensitive kids are to these dyes.\n\nThose studies included \"challenge studies,\" In which kids were on a dye-free diet for several weeks and then given food or drinks with dyes added. The researchers found that some children were more likely to act out after having foods with the dyes. Sixteen of the 25 studies analyzed had some kind of positive association between the dyes and poor behavior in kids, while the link was \"statistically significant\" in 52% of the studies.\n\nIt's important to point out that these food dyes and additives are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and meet acceptable daily intake levels for synthetic food dyes. But Gabriel stresses that those approvals are based on studies that are up to 70 years old. \"Seventy years ago, we had a very different idea of science,\" he says.\n\nGabriel says that some of these food dyes are restricted or banned in Europe. For example, titanium dioxide, which is commonly used in salad dressings and coffee cream, was banned by the European Food Safety Authority over potential connections to cancer. Gabriel adds that \"others require a warning label on the package that says the dyes in these products can cause harm to young people. Because the manufacturers don't want that warning on their product, we have one box of Froot Loops from America and another in Canada, where they're already making these foods without these dyes. It's a minor modification.\"\n\nAlan says that there is \"quite a bit of debate\" on this topic. \"Some of these dyes have been linked to hyperactivity and exacerbation of ADHD,\" she says. \"There are also concerns for cancer and birth defects, although the evidence is less convincing here.\" Overall, she says, more research is needed in this area.\n\nIf the bill passes, it will only apply to food served in schools. \"Schools would no longer be able to offer foods with these dyes during the school day,\" Cesareo says. \"There are many other options that schools can choose to offer that do not have any of these dyes in them.\"\n\nManufacturers will have the option of reformulating their products if they want to continue selling foods with these dyes to schools, he says. \"Many of these brands do already make safer, naturally colored versions of their products that are available in other countries,\" Cesareo adds. Natural dyes, like spirulina for a blue color and beet juice for red, are usually easy substitutes, Alan notes.\n\nIf you live in California and want to keep buying foods with red dye No. 40, Gabriel says you'd be just fine to keep doing that. \"Everyone will be able to buy all the products they love in the supermarket,\" he says. The bill \"just says that we serve a couple million free lunches every day in the state of California, and the food that the school districts are serving need to be free of these dyes.\"\n\nUltimately, Gabriel says he hopes all the scrutiny on food dyes in California will influence the rest of the country, too. \"We will hopefully spur the FDA to pick up their game to bring us up to the same level of protection as other areas of the world. The U.S. is a global outlier in food safety,\" he says. Gabriel says that food manufacturers seem to understand that the need to switch to more natural food dyes is \"inevitable.\" He adds, \"We just want to accelerate the process.\"",

        "body": "German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has called for the rapid admission to the European Union of accession candidates in the Western Balkans as the bloc marks the 20th anniversary of its enlargement by 10 countries in 2004.\n\n\"Political and geographical 'grey areas' in the Balkans or in the east of the EU are extremely dangerous,\" Baerbock wrote in an opinion piece published to mark the anniversary.\n\n\"We cannot afford such grey areas, because for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin they are an invitation to interfere, to destabilize,\" Baerbock said.\n\nThe article, which dpa saw in advance of publication, appears on Monday in media in Lithuania, Latvia, Romania and Greece.\n\nEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Malta and Cyprus were admitted to the EU on May 1, 2004.\n\n\"We have known at least since Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine: The enlargement of our EU today is also a geopolitical necessity,\" Baerbock wrote.\n\nJust like 20 years ago, millions of Europeans today see an opportunity and promise in becoming EU citizens.\n\n\"We cannot afford to have another entire generation languish in the EU waiting room again, as was the case in the Western Balkans,\" she warned.\n\n\"We must not squander the opportunity to make our union bigger and stronger - and therefore more secure.\"\n\nThe generation of the 2004 enlargement round had to summon up the courage \"not to be swayed by headwinds and populist slogans,\" Baerbock said.\n\n\"Our generation is now faced with the task of defending and strengthening the European project of peace and freedom, even if it costs an incredible amount of energy.\" Reforms are necessary for this to succeed, she said. This also includes fewer veto options in the European Council.\n\nIn addition to Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Western Balkan states also include Albania, Serbia, North Macedonia and Kosovo. In Brussels, Montenegro is considered to be the furthest along in the accession process.\n\nEU enlargement is not expected until the end of the decade at the earliest.\n\nThe EU has been conducting accession negotiations with Montenegro since 2012. In March, the EU decided to start accession negotiations with Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nHowever, the first accession conference will only be organized once the country has implemented unfulfilled reform requirements, for example in the fight against corruption and organized crime.\n\nThis Wednesday, May 1, Baerbock plans to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Poland's accession to the EU with her Polish counterpart Rados≈Çaw Sikorski in S≈Çubice and the German border town Frankfurt an der Oder.\n\nA joint visit to the European festival \"European Picnic,\" a joint walk across the Oder Bridge and an exchange with students at the European University Viadrina are planned.",

        "body": "Afghanistan launched a new polio vaccination campaign on Monday aimed at protecting around 10.72 million children under the age of 5, the Health Ministry announced.\n\nThe four-day campaign will cover 31 of the country's 34 provinces. Vaccinations in Ghor, Daikundi and Bamyan provinces will be implemented later due to recent rains and cold weather, the ministry said in a statement.\n\n\"Together with our partners, we are committed to eradicating polio from Afghanistan,\" said Dr Qalandar Ibaad, the Taliban government minister of public health. \"We will work tirelessly and continue polio vaccination campaigns and complementary health services until we reach the goal of fully eradicating polio.\"\n\nThe ministry urged religious scholars and local elders to cooperate with vaccine providers to fight against polio, a debilitating disease that can lead to paralysis and death.\n\nIn December, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the repatriation of migrants from neighbouring Pakistan has increased the risk of spreading the virus. Since then, Afghanistan has conducted at least three rounds of nationwide vaccinations.\n\nVaccination campaigns in Afghanistan and Pakistan often face challenges due to conspiracy theories that polio vaccines cause infertility or that vaccinators are spies.\n\nBefore seizing power in August 2021, the Taliban had banned door-to-door vaccinations in areas they controlled. However, the United Nations successfully negotiated with them to resume the vaccination programme across the country after their return to power.",

        "body": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China hinted on Monday that it could retaliate after U.S. President Joe Biden signed into law legislation to boost Taiwan's defences and seeks to get TikTok's Chinese owner to divest from the social media platform.\n\nBiden signed the legislation on a military aid package on Wednesday, with most of the money going to Ukraine to help it fend off Russia's invasion and to Israel. He also signed a separate bill tied to the aid legislation that bans TikTok in the United States if its Chinese owner ByteDance fails to divest the app over the next nine months to a year.\n\nSpeaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian urged the United States not to implement the \"negative, China-related\" parts of the legislation.\n\n\"If the United States clings obstinately to its course, China will take resolute and forceful steps to firmly defend its own security and development interests,\" Lin said, without elaborating.\n\nThe United States is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier even in the absence of formal diplomatic ties. China, which views Taiwan as its own territory, has repeatedly demanded arms sales stop.\n\nTaiwan's democratically-elected government, which rejects China's sovereignty claims, has welcomed the new legislation saying it will help maintain security in the region.\n\n(Reporting by Laurie Chen; Writing by Bernard Orr; Editing by Christian Schmollinger, William Maclean)",

        "body": "Footage of Indian election officials pressing buttons on an electronic voting machine does not show fraud in the 2024 polls, contrary to social media posts that claimed it showed the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attempting to fix the outcome of the vote. The video, which circulated on Facebook as Indians cast their ballots in the world's biggest democratic exercise, was in fact filmed in 2017. India's Election Commission said officials had failed to delete old data from the electronic voting machine, which caused it to produce incorrect ballot slips.\n\n\"In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, pressed the button for the elephant, the slip came in favour of the lotus,\" read part of the Hindi-language caption of a Facebook post sharing the video on April 19, 2024.\n\nThe elephant and lotus are the party symbols representing the opposition Bahujan Samaj Party and the ruling-BJP (archived link).\n\nThe accompanying video is a news report by Indian broadcaster ABP, with Hindi-language text overlaid that read: \"Pressed the button for elephant but received a slip for lotus.\"\n\nThe one-minute, 30-second clip showed a group of election officials pressing the buttons on an electronic voting machine and a slip displaying a vote for the BJP being dispensed.\n\nAccording to the news anchor, 19 officials from the Bhind district in India's central Madhya Pradesh state were suspended following complaints from the opposition Congress and Aam Aadmi Party alleging the machines dispensed slips in favour of the BJP, even when a button for a different party's candidate was pressed.\n\nThe video was shared alongside similar misleading claims on Facebook here and on X here.\n\nIt surfaced at the start of India's six-week general election, which will see nearly a billion voters head to the polls to elect the 543-member Lok Sabha -- the lower house of the country's legislature -- in the world's largest democratic exercise.\n\nIncumbent Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi is all but assured victory, as a weakened opposition is pushed to the sidelines.\n\nSince 2004, Indians have cast their ballots using electronic voting machines by pressing a button that corresponds to their chosen candidate's name, symbol and serial number (archived link).\n\nThe machine has a voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) unit which displays a slip with the corresponding ballot information for seven seconds before storing it in a sealed drop box (archived link).\n\nIndia's opposition parties have repeatedly raised doubts about the reliability of the machines -- Congress' Rahul Gandhi alleged ahead of the April polls that the machines could be hacked (archived link).\n\nBut the false posts in fact share a news reel about an incident with the voting machines in 2017.\n\nA combination of reverse image searches and keyword searches on Google found a longer version of the video posted on YouTube on April 1, 2017 by Hindi-language broadcaster ABP News (archived link).\n\nThe video is titled: \"EVM Controversy: SP, Collector of Bhind removed.\"\n\nThe clip shared in the misleading posts corresponds to the first one-minute, 30-seconds of the YouTube video.\n\nAccording to the report, the video shows officials testing a voting machine in Bhind.\n\nDuring the test, the machine's voter-verified paper audit trail unit dispensed slips displaying the BJP's lotus symbol, regardless of the candidate selected on the voting machine, the report explained.\n\nBelow is a screenshot comparison of the clip shared in the misleading posts (left) and the video posted on ABP's YouTube channel (right):\n\nThe Times of India reported that the Madhya Pradesh government suspended 20 officials on April 1, 2017, after Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party lodged complaints, saying it raised the possibility of the machines being tampered with ahead of elections (archived link).\n\nOn April 7, 2017, the Election Commission said there was no evidence either machine used in the trial had been tampered with, the Indian Express reported.\n\nIt said an inquiry found a \"lapse\" on the part of the poll officers who did not delete data from a previous election in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. This led to the machines dispensing voter verification slips with candidate information from that election instead.\n\nMeanwhile, the Election Commission posted on X that the video circulating online was from 2017 and referred to its statement on the incident at the time (archived link).",

        "title": "Esther Rantzen says kind strangers will meet her before Dignitas if family can't come",
        "body": "Dame Esther Rantzen has revealed people who live in Zurich have offered to meet her at the plane if her family can't come with her to Dignitas, in Switzerland.\n\nDignitas is a non-profit organisation which provides physician-assisted dying. Here in the UK, Euthanasia is illegal and can be prosecuted as murder or manslaughter.\n\nMPs are poised to debate a petition on assisted dying, backed by Rantzen, in Westminster on Monday after it received more than 200,000 signatures. Rantzen is too unwell to attend the demonstration herself but terminally ill people, bereaved relatives and celebrities will gather outside Parliament to call for change.\n\nHours before the debate, Good Morning Britain aired Susanna Reid's moving conversation with Rantzen about assisted dying. Rantzen continues treatment for stage four lung cancer as she spoke about the kindness of strangers and her family's feelings about Dignitas.\n\nRantzen said: \"As you know, signed up with Dignitas. But it does mean if I go to Switzerland that my family can't come with me for fear of being interrogated by the police, which is not what you want your family to go through.\"\n\nPresenter Reid asked her whether she would consider making the journey on her own. Rantzen revealed the kindness of strangers and how she wouldn't be on her own.\n\nShe said: \"Among the wonderful messages of support there are people who say they'd go with me or people who live in Zurich and would meet me off the plane, so I don't know. It's really a decision for my family to make. They might say, 'The hell with it. We're going with you.' I mean, this whole thing is really to try and save them from a terrible memory.\"\n\nShe added: \"If I knew that was going to be difficult for my family to witness, I would want to be able to ask for help.\"\n\nThe ChildLine founder said we are kinder to our pets when it comes to death. She explained: \"There was Desi, my husband. There was my mother and there was our dog. And there's no question that our dog had the best death. We discovered he had cancer, and before the symptoms got painful, we put him to sleep. We can offer our loved, beloved pets a pain free death, and we can't offer it to our beloved family.\"\n\nSir Keir Starmer has shared his personal support for Rantzen's campaign to legalise assisted dying in the UK. As the debate takes place on Monday, Rantzen shared her hopes of change in the UK.\n\nShe said: \"I hope that some of the MPs who oppose any change in the law listen to some of the evidence that we've now been able to get from around the world because I think that evidence will allay some of their fears.\"\n\nRantzen's daughter Rebecca Wilcox has thrown her support behind her mum. She shared the consequences she would face if she joined her mum at Dignitas.\n\n\"I wish it was up to me,\" she said. \"If it was up to me, I would be there in a shot. That's a terrible phrase to use about assisted dying. I would be there. I would hold her hand. This woman is my person, she's my best friend, I talk to her four times a day about everything and I adore her but if I go with her to Switzerland.\n\n\"I face prosecution, the process can take up to two years, cost thousands in legal fees and I face up to 14 years in prison. I have two young children, I am deputy president of ChildLine. I don't think you can do that with a criminal record...\"\n\nShe added: \"I don't know if it's the right decision. My husband says it's the wrong decision. If it was just me, if I didn't have any dependance I would go.\"\n\nHowever, during an appearance on Good Morning Britain on Monday, she insisted she will do everything in her power to keep the conversation going about assisted dying. She said: \"If it gets lost, I will scream and shout and throw a tantrum on Downing Street's front step. I was there to hand the petition. I know how to get there. I'm on good terms with the guards.\"\n\nGood Morning Britain presenter Richard Madeley cheekily quipped: \"You are your mother's daughter.\"",
