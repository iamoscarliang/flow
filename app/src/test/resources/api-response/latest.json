        "body": "The journey of startups from inception to going public is a transformative process and requires careful attention to governance principles. CII Charter lately highlighted that startup governance is important for establishing a strong foundation and ensure long-term success.\n\nLaying the groundwork is required at the inception stage and this includes forming a board of directors, setting a tone and implementing essential financial process. It is said that the initial steps are crucial for establishing a culture of responsibility and transparency within the organization.\n\nNow, as the startups progresses, the next step is to meeting the demands of growth. Boards take on increased responsibilities and monitor key business metrics. They define decision-making processes and even establish committees such as audit and risk management. Internal control is important to support scaling of operations and managing emerging risks.\n\nThe third is the growth stage and governance takes on a strategic focus in it. Startups usually emphasize stakeholder engagement at this stage by communicating their vision, mission and values clearly. They strengthen a culture of ethics and integrity in the company. They implement policies and procedures to reflect the principles. Diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) are the priorities and should be reflected in board composition and organizational culture as well.\n\nGovernance reaches a new level of complexity when startups prepare to go public. A heightened scrutiny is witnessed on committee functions, fraud prevention and stakeholder management. Governance policies are rigorously reviewed so that it aligns with regulatory requirements like the Companies Act 2013 and SEBI regulations. This stage is crucial as it emphasizes transparency, accountability and effective management of stakeholder relationships.\n\nCertain core principles of governance remain critical throughout the journey and startups must prioritize certain aspects like statutory compliance, transparent fund utilization, strategic progress monitoring and effective human resources management. The startups should also embrace Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) norms as well.",

        "body": "NORMAN WINTER\n\nTribune News Service\n\nSparkling Rose may sound like an adult libation at your favorite Italian restaurant, but in the gardening world it is a Superbena -- or should I say a Super Verbena? Some in the green industry might consider it a novelty bedding plant, mainly due to its coloration. Personally, I don't like the adjective \"novelty,\" mostly because of the dictionary's No. 2 definition, which is small and inexpensive.\n\nSuperbena Sparkling Rose is a Top Performer award winner. It reaches 12 inches tall with a spread of up to 30 inches. It is a perennial in zones 8a and warmer, and like all of the other Superbenas, it will make you look like the Green Thumb Award Winner if you cut back to keep those new shoots developing throughout the growing season.\n\nWhen I was with Mississippi State University, we would have thousands attend the Fall Flower and Garden Fest in October, and we regularly had verbenas in a glorious state of full bloom by cutting them back six weeks before the event.\n\nPeople are also reading...

If I may be so bold, I think everyone shortchanged this verbena. The center of the flower is dark rose, maybe even a lipstick color, and then pink shades spread outward. Your first thought may be: \"What would I do with that?\" The basic answer is: \"Anything you want to!\"\n\nAt the Young Plant Farms Annual Garden Tour in Auburn, Alabama, I photographed a beautiful Proven Winners recipe called Missy. It featured Superbenas Sparkling Rose and Whiteout verbenas, with Superbells Honeyberry calibrachoa.\n\nMy son James created a dazzling planter that featured Superbena Sparkling Rose, Superbells Backcurrant Punch, Supertunia Mini Vista Indigo petunia and Unplugged So Blue salvia. But then with one of his clients who loves flowers to the max, he used it like a special surprise.\n\nIn my photo I saw zinnias, Melinis Savannah Ruby Grass, Compact SunPatiens and Luscious lantanas, and then there were those blooms of Superbena Sparkling Rose verbenas that took you by surprise. Isn't that what we all want, our garden to be one of participation where visitors have to walk it to see and appreciate?\n\nIt was Libby, however, who triggered me to write this column. Libby Breitenbaugh has a Facebook page I follow called Libby's Backyard Wildlife Habitat. Her yard has several habitat certifications, and her photos prove she is most accomplished. As you might guess, she posted photos of the Eastern Black Swallowtail feeding on the nectar from Superbena Sparkling Rose. Way to go, Libby!\n\nSuperbena Sparking Rose verbena is one of two in the sparkling group. The other is Sparkling Amethyst. This one has won even more awards, including Perfect Score at LSU Hammond Research Station and Iowa State University as well as Director's Select at Penn State. My description would be dark amethyst in the center spreading out to white and light amethyst.\n\nProven Winners has one more drop-dead-gorgeous Superbena that could be included in this group. You may want to consider it, too. It is called Superbena Peachy Keen. Its tag says orange and apricot shades to cream. I would say \"bingo\" on that one. The point to remember as you enter your planting season is that you have the opportunity to make your garden sparkling with these bicolored Superbenas. Bees, butterflies and hummingbirds will love them, too.\n\nFollow Norman Winter on Facebook @NormanWinterTheGardenGuy.\n\nTags Botany Gardening Biology Agriculture Internet Entomology Industry Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

        "body": "LONDON/SINGAPORE - The yen jumped sharply against its peers on Monday after it slid past 160 per dollar earlier in the session, with traders citing dollar-selling intervention by Japanese banks.\n\nMeanwhile, European stocks and U.S. futures rose as investors looked towards the Federal Reserve's latest decision on Wednesday and U.S. jobs data on Friday.\n\nThe Japanese currency strengthened about 2% from the initial 159 per dollar level in a matter of a few minutes during Asia hours, as some traders said they had seen selling of dollars onshore.\n\nThe rapid move came just a few hours after the yen tumbled to the weaker side of 160 per dollar for the first time in 34 years.\n\n\"It does look like intervention,\" said Francesco Pesole, currency strategist at ING. \"The recipe, hitting that mark of 160, then it looks like a big chunk of intervention delivered at 5 a.m. (London time)... it just makes sense at this point.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's a very busy week for markets. I suspect that they might have intervened today and then hoping that data in the U.S. and the Fed does not turn too much in favour for the dollar.\" The dollar was last down 1.59% at 155.83 yen, after falling to an intraday low of 154.54 in early European trading. Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda told reporters: \"I won't comment now\" when asked if authorities had intervened. In the broader markets, Europe's Stoxx 600 index was up 0.33% after rising 1.7% last week for its first weekly gain in a month. Germany's DAX was 0.21% higher while the British FTSE 100 rose 0.43%.\n\nInvestors were digesting the latest national euro zone inflation data, including Spanish figures which showed price growth ticked up to 3.4% in April. Data for the bloc as a whole is due on Tuesday.\n\nU.S. stock futures were also higher, with those for the S&P 500 up 0.22% and for the Nasdaq up 0.34%.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 stock index rose 0.81% while China's CSI 300 climbed 1.11%.\n\n\"Sentiment is upbeat at the start of the week, fuelled by relief that inflationary pressures in the U.S. aren't as bad as feared, and hopes return that a ceasefire could be negotiated in the Middle East,\" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nMarkets rallied on Friday as Big Tech gains lifted Wall Street and closely watched inflation data came in as expected on a month-on-month basis.\n\nThe focus of investors on Wednesday will be on whether the Fed strikes a more cautious tone about rate cuts after a string of stronger-than-expected data derailed market expectations on the timing of the first reduction. U.S. nonfarm payroll jobs data will give more clues about the economy on Friday.\n\nMarket pricing shows traders now think the first rate cut will come in November, from a June start only a few weeks ago, with 35 basis points worth of easing expected this year.\n\nThe prospect of rates staying higher for longer has lifted U.S. bond yields and boosted the dollar, although both were lower on Monday.\n\nU.S. 10-year Treasury yields were down 3 basis points to 4.64%, down from a six-month high of 4.739% last week.\n\nAgainst the dollar, the euro rose 0.27% to $1.0721. The dollar index fell 0.33% to 105.61, though was headed for a monthly gain of 1%.\n\nBrent crude fell 0.72% to $88.88 a barrel as news of a potential Gaza ceasefire eased fears of supply constraints.\n\nA Hamas delegation will visit Cairo on Monday for talks aimed at securing a ceasefire, a Hamas official told Reuters on Sunday, as mediators stepped up efforts to reach a deal ahead of an expected Israeli assault on the southern city of Rafah.\n\n(Reporting by Harry Robertson in London and Rae Wee in Singapore; Editing by Bernadette Baum)",

        "title": "Understanding the importance of CPR: Decoding how your hands can save lives - Times of India",
        "body": "Cardiac arrest is one of the leading causes of sudden death in India. Pre-hospital delays and a lack of awareness about precardiac symptoms continue to be the leading causes of sudden mortality from cardiac arrest in India. According to a study, the yearly death rate from Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) in India is close to 7 lakhs. The general public, who is unaware of the symptoms, generally panics during similar situations, resulting in a delay in hospitalisation.Most cardiac arrests occur outside of the hospital, in homes, or in public settings. And, if correct care is not performed, death is expected within an hour following cardiac arrest.\n\nOne of the first steps to do during a cardiac arrest is to contact an ambulance and begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), followed by defibrillation with an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) equipment. During a cardiac arrest, every second counts. And it's time to reconsider how we respond to medical emergencies.1\n\nIn a recent panel discussion broadcasted live on Times of India's Facebook platform, two distinguished cardiologists shed light on the critical role of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) in saving lives. With a combined wealth of experience and expertise, the panellists provided invaluable insights into the significance of CPR in the event of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). To raise public awareness and education about SCA and CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation), which can save lives in emergencies, the Cardiological Society of India (CSI) in association with SATs Academy has launched CALS - CPR as a Life Skill Initiative, which is supported by the Making India Heart Strong, a patient awareness initiative by Sun Pharma.\n\nUnderstanding Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) and its risk factors\n\n\"Sudden cardiac arrest is a sudden and unexpected loss of heart function, breathing, and consciousness. It occurs due to an electrical disturbance in the heart that causes it to stop beating effectively,\" explained Dr P S Banerjee, Cardiologist, Immediate Past President - Cardiological Society of India, setting the stage by elucidating the nature of SCA. \"Without immediate intervention such as CPR, death can occur within minutes.\"\n\nDr A Sreenivas Kumar, Cardiologist, Member - Cardiological Society of India, addressed the question of predictability regarding SCA, stating, \"Several factors contribute to the risk of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). These include underlying heart conditions such as coronary artery disease, previous heart attacks, heart failure, and certain inherited heart disorders. Lifestyle factors like smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, poor diet, lack of physical activity, stress, inadequate sleep, and obesity also increase SCA risk. Additionally, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, and diabetes play significant roles. Prevention strategies include maintaining a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption.\"\n\nThe critical timing of CPR\n\nThe discussion moved on to the critical timing of CPR initiation. \"CPR should ideally commence as soon as possible after identifying a person in cardiac arrest,\" emphasised Dr P S Banerjee, Cardiologist, Immediate Past President - Cardiological Society of India. \"Start CPR if the person shows no signs of life, such as no breathing or only gasping, regardless of the cause. If you encounter someone in need, don't hesitate to begin CPR while awaiting professional medical assistance. \"\n\nPromoting CPR education\n\nThe inclusivity of CPR was another significant point of discussion. \"Contrary to common misconception, anyone can perform CPR,\" affirmed Dr A Sreenivas Kumar, Cardiologist, Member - Cardiological Society of India. \"It doesn't require medical training, although formal CPR training certainly enhances effectiveness. Bystanders who witness a cardiac arrest can follow simple CPR guidelines to provide vital support until professional help arrives. Efforts should also focus on integrating CPR training into school curriculums and workplace safety programs. The more people equipped with CPR skills, the better-equipped society is to respond effectively to cardiac emergencies.\"\n\nThe panel discussion on \"Your Hands Can Save Lives. Learn CPR!!!\" served as a beacon of awareness, urging individuals to take responsibility for their communities' well-being. The insights shared by the eminent cardiologists, Dr P S Banerjee and Dr A Sreenivas Kumar, illuminated the importance of CPR in combating sudden cardiac arrest and underscored the pivotal role each person can play in saving lives.\n\nAs people navigate the uncertainties of life, one thing remains clear - knowledge and preparedness can make the difference between life and death. The call to action is simple: Learn CPR, empower yourself, and become a beacon of hope for those in need. Let your hands be the bridge to life, ready to make a difference when it matters the most.\n\nRef:\n\nSneha Chakraverty. \"Cardiac Arrest at Public Places in India: Need for Change in the Way India Handles Medical Emergency\".

        "body": "The reappearance in a South Sudan court of a former refugee who had been forcibly disappeared more than a year ago points up the urgent need to reform the National Security Service (NSS), Human Rights Watch said today. South Sudan authorities should urgently put an end to the agency's arbitrary arrests and detentions of critics, activists and members of civil society, some of which constitute enforced disappearances, a sign of troubling regression in the country's human rights landscape.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has documented three other cases of enforced disappearance in recent months. Security agents arbitrarily detained two people, including a former Juba City Council leader, without warrants and have since then denied any information about their whereabouts. The agency is also implicated in the disappearance of a youth activist at a checkpoint, which authorities have failed to effectively investigate.\n\n\"South Sudan's security service has for years committed flagrant violations of national and international law without consequence,\" said Mausi Segun, Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \"The egregious violations of people's rights by the security service underscore the need for urgent and meaningful reform of the agency.\"\n\nThe 2014 National Security Service Act gives the agency broad and unqualified powers that enable it to commit serious abuses with impunity. Human Rights Watch has documented that the NSS' exercise of these broad powers has contributed to shrinking the space for civil society, including human rights defenders and independent media. The agency exerts its authority without meaningful judicial or legislative oversight, and its agents are rarely punished for abuses, leaving victims with little recourse for justice.\n\nOn April 24, 2024, the NSS brought Morris Mabior Awikjok Bak, a South Sudanese critic and former refugee in Kenya, before a county court in Juba to face charges of criminal defamation against the director of the agency. Bak had been forcibly disappeared on February 4, 2023, in Nairobi, Kenya, returned to South Sudan, and detained by the NSS, although it refused to acknowledge his detention or disclose his location.\n\nThe Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan had reported on Bak's detention, allegedly by armed Kenyan security forces and a South Sudanese man in civilian dress, his forced return via a charter flight, and his incommunicado - and unacknowledged - detention by the NSS. In April, the agency acknowledged that it was holding him and indicated that it was bringing criminal defamation charges against him, underscoring the untethered abuse of power by the NSS that South Sudan's government tolerates.\n\nAt about 10 p.m. on March 28, security agents took Kalisto Lado, the former head of the Juba City Council, from his home in Juba and bundled him into a pickup truck with at least 10 armed officers, a witness told Human Rights Watch. Other sources reported that Lado had been under physical surveillance due to his outspokenness against irregular land acquisitions in Juba by powerful individuals that is dispossessing the Bari community and had received a warning that the security agency was looking for him. Witnesses believe that he is being held at the NSS headquarters, Blue House, in Juba. The authorities should immediately release him or bring him before a court and charge him with a recognizable offense if there is sufficient evidence of criminal wrongdoing. On April 19, media reported that Lado's family has brought a case against the government at the East African Court of Justice challenging his illegal detention. The government has 45 days to respond to the complaint.\n\nIn late March, the NSS summoned Michael Wetnhialic, a political activist, to the Blue House and detained him, a relative told Human Rights Watch. The authorities have yet to acknowledge his detention or disclose his situation or whereabouts. This is the fourth time the agency has unlawfully detained Wetnhialic. The first was in January 2017 when he was detained in the Blue House for approximately four months, then in September 2018 for a month, and in May 2019 for nearly five months, all for allegedly using Facebook to criticize the agency and senior government officials. During each of his detentions, Wetnhialic was held under poor conditions and denied access to family or a lawyer but was never formally charged.\n\nCredible sources recently told Human Rights Watch that Biar Ajak Marol, a youth activist who headed a local organization called Junubin Chronicles, a nongovernmental group that carries out campaigns on social issues through music, was detained on October 4, 2023, at a checkpoint staffed by joint forces including police, military intelligence, and the NSS. The sources said that Biar was initially held at the Riverside detention facility, then transferred to the Blue House, where he is apparently still being held. Human Rights Watch could not independently verify this.\n\nInterviewees told Human Rights Watch that police and military intelligence authorities engaged in a witch-hunt and harassed seven of Biar's colleagues and friends, accusing them of being involved in his disappearance, arresting and detaining them multiple times, and beating some of them, rather than conducting an effective investigation into his alleged enforced disappearance. The seven were released on the instruction of the public prosecution at various times due to a lack of evidence, witnesses said.\n\nThe NSS also twice prevented Biar's colleagues from holding a news conference about his disappearance, even though they have no legal authority to decide who can hold a public event. It is still unclear where Biar is or why he was detained, and the authorities seem to have ended their investigations.\n\nThe deprivation of a person's liberty by state actors followed by a refusal to acknowledge the act or the whereabouts or fate of the detainee constitutes an enforced disappearance under international law, which is always prohibited and in certain circumstances may constitute a crime against humanity. Human Rights Watch has repeatedly called on the government of South Sudan to credibly investigate all cases of enforced disappearances and ratify the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances.\n\nThe authorities have yet to investigate or prosecute anyone for other enforced disappearances the NSS is implicated in. These include the 2017 kidnapping from Kenya and apparent extrajudicial execution in South Sudan of Dong Samuel Luak, a prominent South Sudanese lawyer and human rights activist, and Aggrey Ezbon Idri, a member of the political opposition, as well as the enforced disappearances of two United Nations staff, James Lual and Anthony Nyero, and an airline employee, James Adieng.\n\nAmendments to the 2014 act introduced to parliament by the justice minister in May 2023 stalled in September after parliament members removed all references to NSS operating detention centers, introduced a new safeguard requiring the agency to obtain a court warrant before any search and seizure, and a new section requiring parliamentary approval for any other functions assigned to the agency by the president or national security council.\n\n\"Members of South Sudan's parliament should set aside party political considerations and act to protect human rights and the rule of law in the interest of all South Sudanese,\" Segun said. \"They should urgently resume their work to reform the National Security Service to impose genuine limits on the role and powers of the agency and ensure accountability for abuses.\"",
